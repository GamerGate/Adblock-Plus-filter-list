Adblock-Plus-filter-list
========================

This is the GamerGate Adblock Plus filter list.

It's an Adblock Plus compatible version of [the GamerGate boycott list](http://makealist.com/content/quinngategamergate-boycott-list).

Installing this filter list will block **ALL** traffic to **ALL** the domains on the boycott list. It won't just block the ads on the domains. It will block the domains entirely. The domains won't load **AT ALL**. No traffic or ad revenue will go to the domains **AT ALL**.

[Click here](http://gamergate.github.io/Adblock-Plus-filter-list/install.html) for installation instructions.

[A GamerGate support list](http://makealist.com/content/quinngategamergate-support-list) and [a GamerGate effects graph list](http://makealist.com/content/gamergate-watch-them-fall) are also available.
